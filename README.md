# do-rogha-bota
Do rogha bota is a Twitter bot that finds two random articles from Irish wikipedia and creates a poll for users to choose between them. You can view (and follow!) it here: https://twitter.com/do_rogha_bota

The name 'do rogha bota' is a pun, similar to 'your choice bot' in English - it's a bot for choosing and it's also your favourite bot.

This code can be easily modified to work for a different language Wikipedia. For example, to create the same bot in English, swap https://ga.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speisialta:Random for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random and edit the sentence to be Topic 1 *or* Topic 2 instead of the Irish 'nรณ'.
